Simple ffmpeg-based video converter

## Install

You need ffmpeg (compiled with libx264, libvpx, libopus and libass support), ffprobe and mpv (at least 0.14, compiled with LUA support) binaries installed in /usr/local/bin/. If you have them in different locations, you can change default paths in the application preferences.
